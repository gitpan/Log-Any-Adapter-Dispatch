NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Dispatch

SYNOPSIS
        use Log::Any::Adapter;

        Log::Any::Adapter->set('Dispatch', outputs => [[ ... ]]);

        my $dispatcher = Log::Dispatch->new( ... );
        Log::Any::Adapter->set('Dispatch', dispatcher => $dispatcher);

DESCRIPTION
    This Log::Any adapter uses Log::Dispatch for logging.

    You may either pass parameters (like *outputs*) to be passed to
    `Log::Dispatch->new', or pass a `Log::Dispatch' object directly in the
    *dispatcher* parameter.
